# LyrSave
A program to keep track of how much the user spends in the PBBG Lyrania and helps them save.
# Motivation
After reading "The Richest Man in Babylon", I came up with the idea to save 10% of my income in Lyrania. It started out with only an 
Excel sheet that had all the logic there. I noticed that the Excel sheet is not so user-friendly and decided to make a bash script that 
simply asks the user the amounts of money they had and spit back out how much they've saved so they don't spend past that point.
