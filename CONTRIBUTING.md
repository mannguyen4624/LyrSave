# Issues
Since this is a fairly small project, any issues you can think of is valid as long as it's not reverting past issues. Submit any issues
and it shall be discussed.
# Pull Requests
Be thorough with your code and tests, make sure your commit messages are detailed, test each corner of the program to make sure everything
works after your changes. Include testing results in your pull request and it will be merged.
# Style
Most of the project is scripts, I'm not sure if there are styling guidelines for scripts so anything goes as long as it is readable. 
Message me if you have suggestions.
# Community
Respect fellow developers, smart or dumb. Ask questions of the smart people and teach the dumb people so that we can all grow together.

Any questions about these guidelines, email me at nguyen.man@husky.neu.edu.
